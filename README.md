# liri-node-app
Week 10 HW

This JavaScript app connects with Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB API's to retrieve data and display that data in the console and save that data in a text file.

Because the api keys are not uploaded to Github, the app will not function properly if run from GitHub.

The following npm modules were used to build this app:

    dotenv
    fs
    request
    node-spotify-api
    twitter
